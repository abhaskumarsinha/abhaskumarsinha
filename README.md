  Hey there! I'm Abhas (aka R3wC13), a student who's always exploring the realms of coding and machine learning.

  ðŸ“š Low on paper, but I'm high on code,<br>
  Unraveling ML puzzles, leaving GPA puzzled.<br>
  Grades lag behind, as my code leaps forward,<br>
  I'm the coding wizard, an enigma explored.
</p>

<p align="center">
  I'm a scholar of algorithms, a virtuoso of lines,<br>
  While my GPA's in the dust, my code truly shines.<br>
  Stacks of syntax, endless loops I transcend,<br>
  While grades try to keep up, I'm already 'round the bend.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Riding the data waves, on a binary spree,<br>
  In this realm of logic, I break GPA's decree.<br>
  Let them scratch their heads, in academic confusion,<br>
  Coding my way to fusion, a trail of innovation.
</p>
