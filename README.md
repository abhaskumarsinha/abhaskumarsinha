  Hey there! I'm Abhas (aka R3wC13), a student who's always exploring the realms of coding and machine learning.
</p>


I talk about Philosophy, Physics, Computation, and AI. If you have something that could interest me, feel free to drop a few of your reading lists to me. :-)

Given today, the tremendous usage of computation systems that consume a lot of power to train large AI systems, it is my goal to realize quantum computational methods (or at least hybrid systems) in the next few decades of future, hence providing a piece of the puzzle solving computational problems for AGI realization.

## Skills and Interests

- Programming Languages: Python, C, Assembly (preferably NASM), PHP, SQL.
- Tools and Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Sci-kit Learn.
- Philosophy: Shunya (Madhyamaka Buddhism), Advaita Vedanta (Ashtavakra's), Sankhya.
- Field: AI (Supervised, Unsupervised Learning, Alignment, Domain Adaptation and related Areas, GPT and text based models), Physics (Quantum Mechanics, Field Theory, General Relativity), Mathematics (Number Theory, Statistics).

## Some of the Quotes in Philosophical formulations

<blockquote align='center'>
<br>
  If, indeed, the present and future are contingently related<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;to the past, they should exist in the past moment.<br><br>

  If, again, the present and future do not exist there (i.e.,<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; in the past), how could they be contingently related?<br><br>

  Again, it is not possible for both (present and future) to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  establish themselves without being contingent on a past.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Therefore, there is no justification for the existence of a<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; present and a future time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i size='1'></text>Inada, Kenneth K. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna: A translation of his M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ with an introductory essay. Vol. 127. Sri Satguru Publications, 1993.</i><br><br>

<i style="font-size: small;">The contradiction arises because if the present and future depend on the past, they either pre-exist (negating their <b>distinctness</b>) or lack a basis for dependence (making the <b>linear-time</b> concept meaningless). Nagarjuna exposes this to challenge our attachment to fixed time concepts and urges us towards understanding emptiness, the absence of inherent existence in phenomena like time in Madhyamaka Buddhism.</i>


<blockquote align='center'>
<br>
2.4<br>
As waves, foam, and bubbles<br>
are not different from water,<br>
so the universe emanating from Self<br>
is not different from Self.<br><br>
2.5<br>
Look closely at cloth,<br>
you see only threads.<br>
Look closely at creation,<br>
you see only Self. <br>

</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ashtavakra Gita

<br>
<i align='justify'>In these verses from the Ashtavakra Gita, the speaker employs metaphors to convey the Advaita Vedanta principle of non-duality. The analogy of waves, foam, and bubbles being inseparable from water illustrates the oneness of the universe with the Self (Atman/Brahman). Similarly, the comparison of creation to cloth and threads emphasizes that, upon close examination, diversity in the world dissolves into the singular essence of the Self. The verses underscore the non-dual nature of reality, urging contemplation on the unity underlying the apparent multiplicity of the universe, like a dream collapsing into a person.</i>
